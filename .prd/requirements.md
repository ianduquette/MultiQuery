# MultiQuery product requirements

The goal is for this to be a simple command line utility that will run queries against the databases specified in the test-environments.json file.
The test-environments.json file is generated by the make-envs.sh script.
The script ran will be the same for each database.
The script MUST only be a SELECT script, DML or DDL operations are not allowed.

**General flow**
- Parse command line args
- Load JSON environments
- For each environment:
    - Connect to database
    - Execute query
        - Transaction MUST BE READONLY!!!
        - Only SELECT queries are allowed
    - Output results to console
- Handle errors gracefully.

Syntax to call will be mutliquery queryfile.sql test-envrionments.json

If you want to save as a file you can say multiquery queryfile.sql test-environments.json > output.csv
